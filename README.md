AwardedBadge813's Beaconite Mod
=======

This mod adds custom items, blocks, and effects to spice up the endgame beacon making process. 
Some notable additions include more usages for nether stars, the ability to condense and collect potion effects, and the ability to increase loot drops using diamonds and similar materials.

If you have an issue with this mod, consider making a report! I'm likely going to stay active on this, so feel free to reach out to me and I'll try to make it right.
also: this is my first mod, so if I have made something wrong or unconventional, I would love to hear any criticisms you have about the code or mechanics!
This mod is made with the MIT license, so you are free to use/decompile/modify the code to see how I did things or get inspired.
This is also made with standard mapping names, the info for that is preserved for the ModDevGradle README below.
Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy my mod!

Mapping Names:
============
By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields 
in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
